## **Overview**
This is a UI assessment for **BitRobot** with a beautiful design provided by their team.

## **Assumptions**
1. **Dashboards should be Solana wallet gated** for individual users to view their stats and progress  
2. **A connect wallet message should be displayed** if a user has not connected their wallet  
3. **A fallback message should be displayed** for views without provided designs (**Contribute, Profile**)
